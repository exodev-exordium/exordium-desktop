# Exordium
*A project by the Exordium Development Team.*

Exordium is a virtual private networking software in the works. **Our goal is to donate all profits made from the VPN towards environmental protection, and to fight against the climate crisis.** 

We hope to share as much of our programming as open source code to help others create their own projects and further the development of software built with `electronjs` and` nodejs`, which are the fundamental pieces to us. 

## 0.4.6

We are currently in the 0.4.* development versions of the Exordium application.

The current version of the Exordium project has come a long way and we will continue to build on and improve its features and design. Thanks to all those who have helped us build on the foundation.

### Features

- `electron-auto-updater`, automatically detects updates from this GitHub repository and downloads and installs them.
- `online/offline`, informs the user on whether their connected to the internet or not (kind of important being that the application is used to create that connection).
- `electron-theme-aware`, detect the system theme settings (works on Mac, and Windows (1903 or higher))
- `discord-rich-presence`, lets all your friends know that you're protected on Exordium.
- Amazing looking design using `bootstrap 4`, `animate.css`, and `font-awesome`.
