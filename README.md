# Odyssey
*A project by the Exordium Development Team.*

This repository allows us to share our Odyssey builds with our customers in a friendly environment designed for development, issue reporting, and proper distribution of our downloads and other related files.

We are currently in the 0.4.* development versions of the Odyssey application.

## 0.4.6

The current version of the Odyssey project has come a long way and we will continue to build on and improve its features and design. Thanks to all those who have helped us build on the foundation.

### Features

- `electron-auto-updater`, automatically detects updates from this GitHub repository and downloads and installs them.
- `online/offline`, informs the user on whether their connected to the internet or not (kind of important being that the application is used to create that connection).
- `electron-theme-aware`, detect the system theme settings (works on Mac, and Windows (1903 or higher))
- `discord-rich-presence`, lets all your friends know that you're protected on Odyssey VPN.
- Amazing looking design using `bootstrap 4`, `animate.css`, and `font-awesome`.
